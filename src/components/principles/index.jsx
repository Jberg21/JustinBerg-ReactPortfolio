                            <br />Evaluate yourself. Where are you losing time and energy? What things are you spending time on daily, weekly, and monthly that is not taking you toward your goal and how do you reduce or eliminate this wasted time?

                            <br />Know your most important things you must be doing and ensure you are doing those every day. There is a huge difference between how the successful and unsuccessful people act. Everyone has whirlwinds of life. The successful have learned to make sure they are doing the key things and taking care of the rest afterwards. The unsuccessful do the least important first and give the important what time is left over. And the craziest thing: the unsuccessful don't even realize they are doing this!

The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough. – Grant Cardone
