                            <h2>To Be Successful At Anything, It Requires Unsexy, Unexciting, Consistent, Hard and Smart Work Done on a Daily Basis.</h2>
                            <br />There are no magic pills, there is no secret sauce. As they say in the exercise world, it’s basic pushups and pullups. The secret is how well can you consistently focus and do the basics. 
                            {/* The key difference between the successful and unsuccessful is the successful have figured out the following: */}
                            <br />
                            {/* <br />1) What it is they need to do. What are the core activities they need to be doing on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis to achieve success.
                            <br />2) How to best organize their daily activities.
                            <br />3) What systems they need to employ to keep them on task.
                            <br />4) Hired a coach to keep them accountable and help them organize the things they need to do.
                            <br />5) Learned how to operate from a 7-10 focus level every day. Every day they are doing their vital functions. Successful rarely have days off where unsuccessful people consistently miss. (look at the LO's production- plain and simple- the higher up their production- the more consistent they are (unless they are brand new)- the lower they are and the more time spent- less consistent)
                            <br />6) Built in guardrails to avoid distractions.
                            <br />7) They stay on their game plan only tweaking from time to time instead of jumping from one marketing system to the next- always looking for the next best thing.

                            {/* <br />What do Tom Brady, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan all have in common?
                            <br />1) They are considered by many to be the G.O.A.Ts (greatest of all time) of their industries.
                            <br />2) They all had coaches- and not any coach- but the best coach they could fine. 
                            <br />3) Coaches help you organize your goals and systems. They point out blind spots, they see things you’re doing that you shouldn’t or things that you’re not doing that you should- and help you see what you’re not seeing yourself. Perhaps the largest benefit of a coach is by having someone you know that you must report back to ten-folds your chance of getting the assignment done by a certain time- which greatly increases your success.
                            <br />4) Millionaire Mindset Real Estate Coaches are certified directly by James Roberts. They spend many days training directly with him along with other hand-picked specialists and must prove mastery before being allowed to represent Millionaire Mindset. And the best part- if you’re eligible- our coaches cost you nothing! */}

                            <br /> When we created our first Master Class: we titled it “Foundations.” A good part of this class is on mindset and how we have been limited by our lack of thinking since we were young.
                            <br /> The mind is a double-edged sword. If we can get it working correctly- it can take us to levels that we never thought possible. If our mind is weak or negative, it will keep us down and never let us soar to the heights we are capable. And the craziest thing of life- those with weak or negative minds have no idea their minds are that way. They just see themselves as realists and ‘that’s the way things are…’ – and stay where they are. */}

                            <h2>No Matter What- Successful Real Estate Agents Keep Their Marketing Going Each and Every Day</h2>
                            {/* <br />This is the #1 law of successful Realtors and any other salespeople. You must market/prospect each and every day. Break it and you’ll never have consistent business.
                            <br />We get it. Life is constantly throwing us curveballs. No one is forcing us to market each day. Clients are not asking us to continually stay in touch. Marketing/Prospecting is not fun like eating ice cream but more like forcing yourself to eat your vegetables. Unsuccessful sales people always encounter the mountains and valleys meaning they go work hard, get a deal or two and then completely stop marketing “because they are too busy taking care of their deals.” Then a month later they are back to zero with no deals.																																						
                            <br />In our 2nd Master Class we teach about Power Hours- one of the most important things you as a real estate agents need to consistently use. Power Hours are to agents like pumping weights is to a body builder. No body builder will ever be successful if they don’t get in the gym and pump weights on a consistent basis. There is no way around it. If all the body builder did was attend classes, watch videos, read books, talk with experts, buy the right clothes, make plans and then keep readjusting those plans- if they do all that but never get in the gym- they will not see any results. Plain and simple.												
                            <br />It’s easier to see this from a body builder perspective but much harder to see for ourselves as Realtors. Think of all the agents you know writing blogs, taking classes, posting to social media, reading books, talking to people, making plans, but they never get in the gym and pump weights- i.e.- daily Power Hours- and then they blame the market, the competition, whatever for their lack of success. */}
