                                        I love connecting with real estate agents in helping them set and reach their goals. Over the years in learning about goal setting and breaking these processes down to make them achievable has been life changing for me and for the people I work with. I am someone who is very passionate about helping people and I love seeing growth within individuals that I help guide through the processes and systems to help them achieve goals they never thought possible! Real Estate in my opinion is a field where there is so much financial gain for those that know how to structure their days and structure their goals, with the right systems and steps, you can make millions of dollars by having a coach guide you through and keep you accountable in your journey.

                                        I have 10 years of progressive experience in the coaching business.
                                        2 years were spent selling a sales coaching program by the name of The Integrity Sales System.  I did introductory coaching to secure the account, then turned it over to our full-time coaches to continue with the coaching process.
                                        8 years were spent coaching with Done For You Real Estate.  I assisted regular, non- real estate people to be able to build their retirement through investment real estate.  I walked them through the entire process, from offer to closing, then had continuous contact with them as they continued to build their real estate portfolio.  As a side benefit, my wife and I were able to purchase investment real estate using the same process.
                                        I love coaching and I love how real estate can help regular people increase their net worth and cash flow and better prepare for their financial future!

That is what coaching is all about and that is how success is measured. That is my commitment to you!

                                        I have been involved in the Real Estate and construction industries over the course of  several decades. Being in the Mortgage side of the industry has opened up opportunities that are interesting and relevant to what I want to do with helping people, Real Estate agents and investors. I am super excited with the direction that our Branch is going and canâ€™t wait to implement the changes.
